#How to Survive Tech Conferences

1.	Connect with a local
与当地人接触
Some people you meet are going to be special.
你将会遇见一些特别的人。
Every now and then I attend an event that transitions from interesting to memorable. It tends to be locals who show you the way. Embrace the unplanned. Instead of going to bed early, think about taking someone up on their offer to go a town over to a hidden absinthe bar where everyone wears goofy hats. Or take a day trip to pet some cheetahs in the surrounding wine country. Or go back to someone’s home and play Rock Band with twenty new friends. These are the memories that stick with me, and I experienced them only because locals took it upon themselves to show off their area.
我时常参加一些活动，有的很有意思，有的令人难忘。 往往是当地人给你指路。拥抱计划外的惊喜。别太早上床睡觉， 考虑下接受某人的建议，到镇子外隐秘处的苦艾酒吧，那里人们都带着滑稽的帽子。 或者回某人家里和二十来个新朋友一起玩摇滚。 这些一直萦绕在我心头的记忆的产生仅仅是由于当地人主动展示当地的魅力。
Look for open, friendly people. They’re everywhere. They know the best tips, and they are likely eager to tell you and show you their city.
The reverse holds true, too. If you’re playing host in your city, pay it forward. It’s your city. Show it off. Attendees are traveling for a reason, and more often than not, showing them your favorite place in the city would thrill them, too.
2.Take photos
I don’t typically check into Foursquare or anything like that, but I do try to take a lot of photos. They tell a story and help me relive specifics of the trip.
I try to geotag every photo. When you’re traveling somewhere different — particularly in a foreign country — it becomes really difficult to relate all of different locations you visited to each other, particularly if you’re taking cabs or public transportation. Geotagging photos gives you a very visual way of piecing together your journey when you load them into iPhoto or Aperture later.
If you’re overseas, usually you don’t have a full data plan on your phone 24/7, but if you switch off of airplane mode it’ll still pick up the GPS coordinates and geotag any photos you take.
If you’re like me and like taking your DSLR out for some shots, it’s a pain to go back and geotag those manually. There’s a few solutions, but the best one I’ve found is gps4cam. Before you start shooting, press the button on your phone to start, and then it’ll record your GPS positioning every minute or so. When you’re done, click finish, and then take a picture of the QR code on your phone. That syncs up the clock on your camera to the clock on your phone so it knows where you were when you took those photos. Then, load your photos on your Mac, run the simple gps4cam sister app, and it’ll go through all of your photos, geotag them and timesync them to the correct time from your phone. It’s kind of like magic.
