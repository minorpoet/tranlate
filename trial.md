#How to Survive Tech Conferences

>###1.	Connect with a local

###1. 与当地人接触
>####Some people you meet are going to be special.

####你将会遇见一些特别的人。

>Every now and then I attend an event that transitions from interesting to memorable. It tends to be locals who show you the way. Embrace the unplanned. Instead of going to bed early, think about taking someone up on their offer to go a town over to a hidden absinthe bar where everyone wears goofy hats. Or take a day trip to pet some cheetahs in the surrounding wine country. Or go back to someone’s home and play Rock Band with twenty new friends. These are the memories that stick with me, and I experienced them only because locals took it upon themselves to show off their area.

我时常参加一些从有趣变成难忘的活动。 往往是当地人给你指路。拥抱计划外的惊喜。别太早上床睡觉， 考虑下接受某人的建议，到镇子外隐秘处的苦艾酒吧，那里人们都带着滑稽的帽子。 或花一天的行程去附近的酒乡摸一摸猎豹，又或者回某人家里和二十来个新朋友一起玩Rock Band。 这些一直萦绕在我心头的记忆的产生仅仅是由于当地人主动展示当地的魅力。

>Look for open, friendly people. They’re everywhere. They know the best tips, and they are likely eager to tell you and show you their city.
The reverse holds true, too. If you’re playing host in your city, pay it forward. It’s your city. Show it off. Attendees are traveling for a reason, and more often than not, showing them your favorite place in the city would thrill them, too.

哪儿都有开放、友好的人，去寻找这些人。他们有最好的建议，而且很可能渴望告诉你这些建议来展示他们城市的魅力。反过来也一样。如果你作为东道主，那么延续这种做法。因为这是你的城市，去展现它的魅力。参与者总是基于某种原因才旅行的。大多数情况下，这城市里你自己最喜欢的地方同样会使他们兴奋的。

>###2.Take photos

###2. 拍照

>I don’t typically check into Foursquare or anything like that, but I do try to take a lot of photos. They tell a story and help me relive specifics of the trip.

我没有刻意的将行程记录在Foursquare网站或者其他类似的东西。 不过我试着拍很多照片，它们描述着故事并帮我回忆这趟旅程的细节。

>I try to geotag every photo. When you’re traveling somewhere different — particularly in a foreign country — it becomes really difficult to relate all of different locations you visited to each other, particularly if you’re taking cabs or public transportation. Geotagging photos gives you a very visual way of piecing together your journey when you load them into iPhoto or Aperture later.
If you’re overseas, usually you don’t have a full data plan on your phone 24/7, but if you switch off of airplane mode it’ll still pick up the GPS coordinates and geotag any photos you take.
If you’re like me and like taking your DSLR out for some shots, it’s a pain to go back and geotag those manually. There’s a few solutions, but the best one I’ve found is gps4cam. Before you start shooting, press the button on your phone to start, and then it’ll record your GPS positioning every minute or so. When you’re done, click finish, and then take a picture of the QR code on your phone. That syncs up the clock on your camera to the clock on your phone so it knows where you were when you took those photos. Then, load your photos on your Mac, run the simple gps4cam sister app, and it’ll go through all of your photos, geotag them and timesync them to the correct time from your phone. It’s kind of like magic. 

我试着给每张照片打上地理标签。当你在某个陌生的地方旅行时（特别是在国外），把你到过的所有的不同的地点关联起来将变得十分困难，尤其是当你乘出租车或其它公共交通工具的时候。当日后你将照片载入iPhone或者Aperture时，打上地理标签的照片以非常可视化的方式来拼凑出你的旅途。如果在你在海外，你通常不会全天开启你的数据流量，不过，即使你开启飞行模式来关闭流量服务， 手机任会获取GPS坐标并给你拍的每张照片打上地理标签。如果你像我一样喜欢带着单反出去拍照，那么回去手工打上地理标签的过程就比较痛苦了。有一些解决方法，但目前我发现最好的就是gps4cam。在你拍照之前，按下你手机上的按钮来开始，然后它会每隔一会记录一下GPS定位。当你拍完时， 点击结束按钮，然后拍下你手机上的二维码。这步骤同步相机上的时钟和手机上的时钟，这样就知道你是在什么时候拍的这些照片了。接着，把你照片加载到Mac上，运行gps4cam的一个简单子应用，它会遍历你所有的照片，打上地理标签并将时间校准到你手机上正确的时刻。这很神奇吧。
